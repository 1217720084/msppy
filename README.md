# MSPPy
## Installation
```bash
python setup.py install
```
## Quick start examples
Some tiny-scale problems can be found in the quick_start folder. The purpose of these examples are getting you familiar with the package. None of them are realistic and useful. Summary of the examples:    
  a_simple_MIP.py: stage-wise independent finite discrete MSIP.    
  absoulte.py: stage-wise independent finite discrete MSLP.    
  air_conditioners.py: stage-wise independent finite discrete MSLP.    
  news_vendor.py: Markov chain MSLP.    
  portfolio_optimization.py: Markovian MSLP.    
  selling_tickets.py: stage-wise independent finite discrete MSIP.    
  semiconductor.py: Markov chain MSLP.    
## Examples
Three real-world large-scale examples--power system planning, portfolio optimization, airline revenue management, can be found in the examples folder. For more details, users are referred to the paper linked below.
## Documentations
Documentations are currently developing and will be released soon.
